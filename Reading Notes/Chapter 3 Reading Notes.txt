Chapter 3.01 Introducing Pandas Objects
	The indicies for pandas series are explicit instead of implicit like NumPy.

	DataFrames are 2 dimensional versions of series. There are explict column names and explict row indicies.
	A column in a dataFrame is a pandas series or dictionary.

	index objects are immutable arrays.
		They cannot be modified in the normal ways ind[x] = value.
		& - intersection of index objects
		| - union of index objects
		^ - symmetric difference

Chapter 3.02 Data Indexing and Selection
	
	In pandas series, when slicing the python normal indicies are used (0,1,2,3...).
	use the .loc attribute to refer to the pandas indicies.
	use the .iloc attribute to refer to the python indicies.
	ix is equivalent to the the standard []-based indexing.

	DataFrames info:
		we can use attribute-style access with column names that are strings

		Like with the Series objects discussed earlier, this dictionary-style syntax can also be used to modify the object, in this case adding a new column:

		data['density'] = data['pop'] / data['area']

	to examine the underlying data, use data.values

	Transpose data: data.T
